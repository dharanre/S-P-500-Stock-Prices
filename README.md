The CV indicates high variability in the closing prices relative to the mean.
3. Visualization
Top 10 Most Frequent Stock Symbols
A bar chart was created to show the top 10 stock symbols with the highest frequencies in the dataset.
Observation: Certain stocks appear more frequently, likely due to higher trading activity or importance in the index.
(Include the bar chart here if presenting a full document.)

4. Inferences
Non-Graphical Techniques:
Central Tendency Measures: The mean provides an average stock closing price, but the high standard deviation and CV suggest significant price dispersion.
Standard Error: Indicates the precision of the sample mean; here, the small standard error reflects a reliable estimate of the mean.
Graphical Techniques:
Bar Chart: Effectively highlights the distribution and activity of stock symbols, offering a clearer understanding of stock trading patterns.
5. Conclusion
The non-graphical techniques (e.g., mean, standard deviation) quantitatively summarize data, offering numerical insights into stock price variability.
Graphical techniques like bar charts provide an intuitive and visual understanding of patterns and distributions.
Combining these techniques gives a holistic view of the dataset, identifying trends and relationships effectively
